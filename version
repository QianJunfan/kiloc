Alpha 0.0.3: (Updated on Oct 2, 2025, by @QianJunfan (https://github.com/qianjunfan))
	Update Log:
		Implemented a box component.

	Next Update:
		Prepare to refactor the entire kiloc framework to make it more user-friendly.
		Prepare to add the layer system and the focus control system.

	Future Plan:
		Plan to add a canvas component, which will be a virtual canvas with its own dedicated buffer.
		Plan to add more text components, such as a text component that automatically wraps lines.
		Implement an event system for the component library.
		Once the features and architecture are stable, work will begin on usage documentation and performance optimization.

        Update Log:
                    Rearchitected the previous kiloc structure and added comments.
                    (some comments may be verbose, others too brief, and will be adjusted later, but comments are now at least present).
                    Another key update is that kiloc now supports UTF-8 characters, 
                    as well as background color, foreground color, bold, italic, and underline styles.
        Next Update: (Implementation Order)
                    Add an aesthetically pleasing box component with a title.
                    Add built-in focus control functionality (mouse and keyboard).
                    Add layer functionality.
                    Add built-in event system (such as clicking, scrolling, selection, etc.).
                    After the features and architecture are stable, work will begin on writing usage documentation and optimizing performance.

Alpha 0.0.1: (Updated on Sep 25, 2025, by @QianJunfan (https://github.com/qianjunfan))
      Update Log:
                  This is kiloc's first update. Currently, it is only a small, not-very-robust prototype. 
                  The code is messy, it doesn't support UTF-8, and it lacks color output. In short, it's very basic (but functional).
                  However, it already includes a basic, relatively stable underlying rendering pipeline and the rudiments of a component system.
      Next Update: (Implementation Order)
                  Refactor all code, improve all function documentation and standards, and add support for UTF-8 and more colors.
                  Add built-in focus control functionality (mouse and keyboard).
                  Add built-in event system (such as clicking, scrolling, selection, etc.).
                  Add layer functionality.
                  After the features and architecture are stable, work will begin on writing usage documentation and optimizing performance.
